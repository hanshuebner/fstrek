# Fullscreen TREK for RSTS/E

fstrek is a re-creation of the classic text-based Star Trek game that
supports full-screen gameplay for VT52 and VT100 (ANSI compatible)
terminals.

It is written in Digital Equipment Corporation's BASIC Plus for the
RSTS/E operating system.

This program was originally written by Bob Flanders and released on
June 3, 2022.
